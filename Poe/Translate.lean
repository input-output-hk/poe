# D1: LCNF → UPLC translator (stub)

The tap point is mono-phase LCNF (`Lean.Compiler.LCNF`): strict,
let-normalized, types/proofs already erased. Mapping (see PLAN.md):

  let x := e; body        ~>  [(lam x body) e]
  fun / application       ~>  lam / app        (CEK does closures)
  constructor application ~>  (constr i ...)
  cases                   ~>  (case ...)
  projection              ~>  single-branch case
  join points             ~>  let-bound lams (nullary: delay/force)
  recursive def           ~>  fix via self-application
  Int/Bool/... primitives ~>  builtin shim table

Open questions 1-2 in PLAN.md (LCNF API surface at 4.24.0; what structural
recursion looks like post-compilation) get answered here first, by inspecting
`Lean.Compiler.LCNF.getMonoDecl?` output for the example functions before
any translation code is written.

## Translation context

LCNF binds variables by `FVarId`; UPLC's `Term.var` is a de Bruijn index.
`Ctx` records, for each `FVarId` currently in scope, the binder *depth* at
which it was introduced (0 = outermost), plus the current depth. At a use
site the index is `depth - 1 - bindingDepth` (0 = innermost enclosing
binder), matching `Poe.Emit`'s convention.

  depth : Nat := 0

  self  : Option (Name × Nat) := none

      opposite `case` convention (see `dataListLoopBody`'s comment): cons
      first as a 2-arg lambda, nil second as a bare term, not the
      declaration-order SoP layout. A list extracted from `Data` this way
      stays native at every further `cons`/`cons`/... position walked off
      it, so the tail gets marked again wherever it's bound. -/

## Recursion: fix via self-application

UPLC has no named top-level recursive bindings, so a self-recursive `Decl`
(`sumList` calling `sumList` by name in its own LCNF body) gets wrapped in
the standard call-by-value fixpoint combinator (the "Z combinator", safe
under CBV unlike the naive Y combinator since the self-application is
guarded behind a lambda):

  fix f = (λx. f (λv. x x v)) (λx. f (λv. x x v))

so that `fix (λself. body[self])` reduces, on each call to `self`, back to
`body[fix (λself. body[self])]` — tying the knot without a named binding.
-/

/-- `λx. f (λv. (x x) v)`, referencing `f` as the (as yet unbound) variable
    at de Bruijn index 1 — correct once nested directly under the `lam "f"`
    in `zCombinator`. -/

  .lam "x" (.app (.var 1) (.lam "v" (.app (.app (.var 1) (.var 1)) (.var 0))))

## `decodeByteStringList`: a bespoke native-list-decode intrinsic

`Poe.PlutusData.decodeByteStringList` is special-cased by name (in
`translateConstCall`) to this hand-built loop instead of being translated
from its Lean body — `unListData`'s own output is UPLC's *native* builtin
list, which the ordinary `case` translation (built for our SoP `constr`
encoding of Lean's `List`) targets a *different* representation. But
`case` itself works directly on a native list too, given the right
branch shape — verified directly against `uplc`: a scrutinee that's a
native list takes exactly two alternatives, a 2-argument lambda
(head/tail) for the cons case *first*, then a bare 0-argument term for
nil *second* (the opposite order from our own SoP convention, and no
`headList`/`tailList`/`nullList`/`ifThenElse` needed at all — found by
comparing Plinth's real compiled output against ours, where Plinth's
version was substantially smaller for exactly this reason). Uses the same
fixpoint combinator as ordinary recursive decls to walk the list, building
an ordinary SoP `constr`-encoded `List ByteArray` as it goes, so
everything downstream of this one primitive is back in the regular
fragment.

## Generic `Data`-record accessors: `constrTag`/`field0`/`field1`/`field2`/`field8`

Real records like `ScriptContext`/`TxInfo` are just `Constr tag [field0,
field1, ...]` (verified against `plutus-ledger-api` source:
`makeIsDataSchemaIndexed` always assigns single-constructor records tag 0,
sum-type variants their declared index — e.g. `Maybe`'s `Just`/`Nothing`
are 0/1). These accessors are purely *positional* — the same `field0`
works on `ScriptContext` (→ `TxInfo`), `ScriptInfo`'s `SpendingScript`
payload (→ its `TxOutRef`), `Maybe`'s `Just` payload, or a user's own
single-field `Datum` record — since `unConstrData` gives back the field
list regardless of what the record "means". `field8` exists only because
`TxInfo.txInfoSignatories` happens to sit at index 8 in the real 16-field
record.

These are purely positional, so they use `fstPair`/`sndPair`/`headList`/
`tailList` chains rather than the `case` trick `decodeByteStringList` uses:
`case` pays for a fresh `(lam h (lam t ...)) (error)` wrapper per field
level, which for a fixed unrolled depth costs more than the builtin chain —
the `case` form only wins for genuinely-recursive loops. -/
