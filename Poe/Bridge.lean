# D5 (stretch): the increment-2 bridge to PlutusCoreBlaster

`Poe.Uplc.Term`/`Builtin`/`Program` were deliberately built isomorphic,
constructor for constructor, to Blaster's own
`PlutusCore.UPLC.Term.Term`/`BuiltinFun`/`Program` — confirmed directly by
reading Blaster's source, not assumed. `toBlasterTerm`/`toBlasterBuiltin`/
`toBlasterProgram` below are exactly the "mechanical injection"
`Poe.Uplc`'s own doc comment already promised: a total, structural
embedding, no partiality or cleverness needed. `Const`/`DataValue` are
*not* full isomorphisms (an earlier version of this comment claimed
otherwise — corrected after an independent review caught it, not found by
the author): they're a deliberate embedding of only the sub-fragment Poe
needs, into Blaster's real, larger `Const`/`Data` types (see `Poe.Uplc`'s
own doc comment for specifics).

**Two real gaps, found by actually trying this rather than assuming it
away**:

* Blaster's `ByteString` is backed by a Lean `String`
  (`structure ByteString where data : String`), not a `ByteArray` like
  `Poe.Uplc`'s own `Const.bytestring`. These are *not* interchangeable —
  an arbitrary byte sequence is not valid UTF-8, so there is no honest,
  total `ByteArray → Blaster.ByteString` embedding via simple
  reinterpretation. `toBlasterConst`/`toBlasterData` below are left
  unimplemented (`sorry`) for `bytestring`/`data`, flagged explicitly
  rather than silently doing something wrong — resolving this (probably:
  Blaster gaining a real byte-sequence representation, or Poe restricting
  this specific certificate direction to the `ByteArray`-free part of the
  fragment) is follow-up scoping work, not something to paper over here.
* `Poe.Uplc.DataValue` itself is missing two of real `Data`'s five cases
  (`Map` *and* `I`, integer-as-`Data` — see `Poe.Uplc`'s own doc comment),
  not just the one this file's comment previously claimed. Independent of
  the `ByteString` gap above, this means `toBlasterData` can't represent
  an integer-literal `Data` value at all yet either. -/

## D5 (stretch): certificate theorem, proved for `double`

`PlutusCore.UPLC.CekMachine.cekExecuteProgram : Program → List Term → Nat
→ State` is fuel-limited (`Nat` steps) via `runSteps`, which (checked
directly, not assumed) treats fuel exhaustion *before* halting as
`State.Error` too — `Eval`/`Return` states never escape `runSteps` itself
— so `Halt`/`Error` are the only two possible results, and the natural
certificate shape is existential over fuel: for every input, *some*
amount of stepping reaches the halted state matching the source
function's real Lean value.

`doubleUplcTerm` is `double`'s already-`plc`/oracle-verified compiled
shape (see `Poe.Examples.First`), transcribed by hand rather than
threaded through `Poe.Translate.translate` (a `CoreM` metaprogramming
action, not plain data a `theorem` statement can reference directly) —
matching the same "hand-built term, checked to match the real
translator's output" methodology `Poe.Examples.First`'s own opening
section already uses.

**Correction (found by an independent adversarial review, not by the
author):** the first version of this transcription dropped the
`let`-desugared identity-continuation wrapper (`(lam x1 x1) [...]`)
`Poe.Translate.translateCode`'s `.let` case *always* emits (`.app (.lam
_ body) v`, visible in every dumped example in `Poe.Examples.First`,
e.g. `head`/`divide`'s own `[(lam x2 x2) ...]` wrappers) — a real gap
between what this file claimed to certify and what it actually
matched. Confirmed directly (`#eval Poe.Emit.emit (←
Poe.Translate.translate ``Poe.Examples.double)`) that the real output
is `(lam x0 [(lam x1 x1) [[(builtin addInteger) x0] x0]])`, and that it
needs 20 CEK steps to `Halt`, not 15 — the version below is the
corrected, byte-identical transcription, re-verified against the real
translator's own emitted text, not eyeballed.

**Actually proved**, not just stated (D5's own bar was only "state, not
necessarily prove" — this clears it): traced by hand and cross-checked
against `#eval`, 20 CEK steps exactly reach `Halt` for any input
(`AddInteger`'s own evaluation never branches on its operands' specific
values, so the same fixed step count works for every `x`, not just the
ones tried) — and, found empirically rather than assumed, plain `rfl`
discharges the whole thing: the kernel unfolds `toBlasterTerm`/
`toBlasterBuiltin`/`step`/`runSteps`/... symbolically for the free `x`
without ever needing to know its concrete value. -/

/- `#print axioms` reports `sorryAx` here — worth being exact about why,
   rather than either hiding it or overclaiming a gap in *this* proof.
   `doubleUplcTerm` has no `.const` node at all, so `toBlasterTerm`'s
   reduction on it never touches the `.const c => .Const (toBlasterConst
   c)` branch, and the certificate above is genuinely, fully proved for
   `double` — confirmed directly: `toBlasterTerm` itself (just the plain
   function, no theorem involved) already reports `sorryAx` via `#print
   axioms`, since it's one *general* function over all of `Poe.Uplc.Term`
   and one of its branches calls `toBlasterConst`, which has real
   `sorry`s for `bytestring`/`data`. Lean's axiom tracking is
   per-declaration, not per-execution-path: mentioning a sorry'd
   function at all taints the whole definition, regardless of whether a
   specific input's reduction ever reaches that branch. Only resolving
   the real `ByteArray`/`ByteString` gap (see file doc comment) would
   make this go away without restructuring the bridge to dodge it. -/

## Certificate 2: `absInt` (branching, still no partiality/recursion)

The natural next step up from `double`: introduces real branching
(`Decidable`/`ifThenElse`/`Force`/`Delay`) into the proof for the first
time. `absIntUplcTerm` is `absInt`'s own already-`plc`/oracle-verified
compiled shape (see `Poe.Examples.First`), hand-transcribed the same way
`doubleUplcTerm` was.

Unlike `double`, the two branches take a *different* number of CEK steps
to reach `Halt` (the negation branch does one extra `SubtractInteger`) —
found empirically, not assumed: 47 steps for the identity branch (`x ≥
0`), 60 for the negation branch (`x < 0`). Since `runSteps` stays
`Halt`ed once it gets there regardless of extra fuel, a single shared
`n = 60` (the larger of the two) works for *every* `x`, sidestepping the
need to pick a different `n` per branch.

**Proved, not just stated** — but this one needed real fighting, worth
recording: a `by_cases h : x < 0` split doesn't work at all, because
`rfl` (kernel definitional equality) never consults local hypotheses —
`h` sits inert in context while the kernel tries to reduce `x < 0`'s
`Decidable` instance for a fully opaque `x` and gets stuck. The fix that
actually works: `rcases x with n | n`, splitting on `Int`'s own two
*constructors* (`ofNat`/`negSucc`) instead of the `Prop` `x < 0` — this
makes `x` a genuine (still-symbolic-in-`n`) constructor application, not
an opaque variable with an external fact about it, and `Int.negSucc_lt_zero`
supplies the one remaining fact rfl-reduction can't derive on its own
(that *any* `negSucc n` is negative). The `ofNat n` branch closes by bare
`rfl`; the `negSucc n` branch needed each real builtin's own
implementation (`ifThenElse`, `subtractInteger`, `expectedArgs`, ...)
explicitly named in the `simp` set one at a time, following each "still
stuck here" error — `PLC.lessThanInteger`/`PLC.subtractInteger`/etc. turned
out to have the exact same "reduces via equation lemmas, not bare kernel
whnf" property `toBlasterTerm` did for `double`, just several functions
deep, chained through `evaluateBuiltinFunction`'s own dispatch. -/
