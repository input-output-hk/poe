# Minimal UPLC AST

`Term`/`Builtin`/`Program` are deliberately isomorphic, constructor for
constructor, to PlutusCoreBlaster's real `PlutusCore.UPLC.Term`/`BuiltinFun`/
`Program` (de Bruijn indices, display-only names on `Lam`) — confirmed
directly against Blaster's own source, not assumed, so that the increment-2
bridge (`Poe.Bridge`) is a mechanical injection for these three.

`Const`/`DataValue` are *not* full isomorphisms, despite earlier claims to
that effect here (caught by an independent review of `Poe.Bridge`, not
found by the author) — they're a deliberate embedding of only the sub-fragment
Poe needs. Real `Const` has several more cases (BLS12-381 curve points, a
general `Pair`, list/pair-of-`Data` optimizations) Poe's fragment never
produces. -/

/-- Real Plutus Core `Data` has two more cases than this — `Map` *and* `I`
    (integer-as-`Data`, common on-chain for quantities/`POSIXTime`/indices) —
    corrected here after an independent review found this comment previously
    undercounted the gap (claimed only `Map` was missing). Neither is needed
    by any current Poe example (see `Poe.PlutusData`), but this means
    `DataValue` cannot represent a real `Data` value built from an integer
    literal at all yet, independent of the `ByteArray`/`ByteString` gap
    `Poe.Bridge` already documents. `constr`'s `Nat` is the constructor tag
    (e.g. `ScriptContext`/`TxInfo` are always tag 0 — single-constructor
    records; `Maybe`'s `Just`/`Nothing` are tags 0/1 respectively — both
    verified against `plutus-ledger-api` source, not assumed). -/
